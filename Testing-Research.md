# Milestone 3: Test Plan - Research and Rough Draft


## Quality Assurance Strategy



## Test Outline

### Unit Testing

#### Handle an exception in python:

try:
       (try something that can give an assertion)

except (specific assertion)
       (what to do when you see the assertion)
except:
       (how to handle any other assertion)
else:
       print("Nothing went wrong.")
finally:
       (always runs even when assertion occurs)

#### Raise an exception in python:

raise Exception("raise an exception")

#### Assert statement

assert x == "something"

If the condition is false, assert an exception.



### Integration Testing

### End-to-End Testing

## Code Convention
