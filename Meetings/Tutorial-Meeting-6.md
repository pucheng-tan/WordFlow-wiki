## Meeting Notes
- Reviewing GUI Libraries. TKINTER GUI by Cameron, showed us a sample as well as code as to basics of how TKINTER works.
Yuta showed a demo for the KIVI GUI, very flexible and lots of functions but requires a lot of modules which could make files very large. Considering having a keyboard on screen that shows what is being inputted.

Feed back on Milestone 2
- Need to show relationships between our objects for the UML Diagram.
- Also we might want to consider reducing the amount of architecture styles we are using or look into Model View Controller style. 

Testing
- Directory called Test Examples on the gitlab, Tara showing some basic examples from a tutorial. She also showed tests for the API Service
- Also looking at coding conventions for our tests.
