## Agenda

1. Discuss the test strategy (Unit/ Integration/ End to end/ …)
2. Choose a GUI library and do proof of concept (PyQt/ tkinter/ …)
3. Discuss code convention
4. Assign some work if ready to do so

## Meeting Notes
### Test strategy
- unit testing
- make a brainstorming doc on Google Drive
- Test driven development vs testing afterward? Bit of a combination to catch things unknown/not thought of at outset
- tests on different levels? (on different classes or more on the feature end-to-end?)
- "spamming buttons testing" - there's a name for it and we should do it!
- PyTest API? unittest library? https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/ https://youtu.be/byaxg00Gf9I
- call DB for functions very specific for that, but when testing functions that are all about the computations/logic, look into mock db to lessen API hits
 
### Code Convention
- Functions:
  - key bind
  - camelCase names
  - interface on method (similar to Javadoc comments /** */)
- Variables:
  - naming based on type? (is_complete: boolean, num_students: number, etc, esp for custom entities)

### Other things
- everyone work on brainstorming
- everyone looking at GUI libraries
- PoC on GUI
- PoC on data (will have to look at querying subcollections)
- Kawser suggests start coding during this milestone
