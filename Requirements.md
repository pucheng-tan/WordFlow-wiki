# Project Description
Word Flow is an application to train users to type faster and with greater accuracy. The focus is on unique uses not covered by other typing tools- special characters used by programming languages, and typing from audio content. It is designed with typing classes in mind:
- Users can complete a variety of typing challenges and view their speed and accuracy for each challenge and see how they have improved over time.
- Admin users can create Groups of users, assign them challenges to complete, and view reports for these users.
- Super Admin users can create a School, invite users to join, and assign users to be managed to Admins.

The typing challenges will range from standard English words, to specific programming languages, and typing from audio dictation. It can check the user's input text against the challenge text, showing the user where they are in the text and if they have made any errors, and how long they have spent on the challenge. Once complete, they will see their speed and accuracy for the challenge.
The application is designed for desktop environments and created in the Python programming language. It utilizes the Firebase API for user and database management so that users can access their account information from different devices. Audio content for dictation mode will be received from an external API and played over device speakers.
