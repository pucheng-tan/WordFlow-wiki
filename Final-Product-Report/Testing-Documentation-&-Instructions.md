■ How do we run tests? (This should be documented in your repository
README.md file, feel free to link to it.)

■ Which parts of your system are tested? Why did you focus on them?

■ Which parts of your system are not tested? Why? How might you strategize
about testing them in the future?

■ Are there third-party libraries used specifically for testing? (Include a list of them including the URLs for their documentation and version used.)
