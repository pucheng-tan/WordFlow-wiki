components for important changes based on the final product, including:

[Design Storyboards](/Design/Design-Storyboards)
-So far no changes to design storyboards

-We mainly followed the storyboards when building the GUI, little changes are needed here

● UML class diagram(s)

● UML component diagram(s)

● UML sequence diagram(s)

● Persistent Storage Details

[Persistent Storage Details](/Design/Persistent-Storage-Details)

-Not many changes, maybe add index number to each of the typing challenge documents
