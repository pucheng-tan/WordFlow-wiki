As-Built Design

■ Revisit and revise your Design Document from Milestone 2; provide updated
components for important changes based on the final product, including:

● Design Storyboards


[Design Storyboards](/Final-Product-Report/As-Built-Design/Design-Storyboards)

-We mainly followed the storyboards when building the GUI, little changes are needed here

● UML class diagram(s)

#### Note: The diagram is quite large, so click on it to get a better view.

● UML component diagram(s)

#### Added a new section for a dictation challenge. The notable change here is that the text to speech library component connects with the challenge content component and user input component. This is because the text to speech library needs the typing challenge challenge to read it out, but it also needs to know the user input, because it only reads out a new word on a space.

● UML sequence diagram(s)

[Sequence diagrams](/Final-Product-Report/As-Built-Design/Interaction-Diagrams)

● Persistent Storage Details

[Persistent Storage Details](/Design/Persistent-Storage-Details)

-Not many changes, maybe add index number to each of the typing challenge documents
