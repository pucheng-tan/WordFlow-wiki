The Authentication Screen does not have a "Forgot Password?" label.
Rather, the only way for a user to change their password is to log in and go to My Profile.
This is because a user being able to reset their password was a should have feature and did not get implemented until very near the end of the deadline so due to time constraints, it wasn't added into the Authentication Screen.
