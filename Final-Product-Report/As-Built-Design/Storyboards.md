# Authentication

## Authentication (No User Yet)

Differences:

The Authentication screen does not have a "Forgot Password?" label.
Rather, the only way for a user to change their password is to log in and go to My Profile.
This is because a user being able to reset their password was a should have feature and did not get implemented until very near the end of the deadline so due to time constraints, it wasn't added into the Authentication screen.

## Create User (existing school)

Differences:

The Create User screen does not have an "Invite Code" entry, because there didn't seem to be a need for it.

# Expanded Side Menu Items

Differences:

The menu items don't expand. After a working main menu was made with only buttons on the menu items, work was started on the active windows and ultimately, there was not enough time to go back and make the menu items so that they could expand.

This can be seen in the image of the main menu below as there are no arrows on the menu items.

# User Management

Differences:

There is no search bar. This is due to time constraints. Instead of being able to search for a specific user, the admin or super-admin will have to click on tab with the privilege level of the desired user and scroll to find them.
