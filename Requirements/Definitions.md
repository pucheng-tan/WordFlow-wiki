# Application Terminology

## Typing Challenge
A user is given a segment of text to type, either by being shown the characters on their screen, or by playing it as audio on their speakers. The user must enter the text into the text input to complete the challenge.

## Words Per Minute (wpm)
- The average number of words per minute that a user is able to type.
- Given s = total time of typing challenge (seconds) and c = total number of correct characters typed (including spaces and punctuation):
   - wpm = (c / 5) / (s / 60)

## Accuracy
- The ratio of correct characters typed vs the total number of characters in the challenge:
- Given t = total characters in the challenge, and c = total number of correct characters typed
   - accuracy = c / t
