# System Architecture Details

- intro paragraph

- paragraph for pipes and filters style

- paragraph for OOP style

For our system architecture style, one of the styles chosen was the object-oriented style. The reason for this is that our typing tool has various real world things such as users, Classrooms, and Schools. The object-oriented style allows us to represent these objects as components in a system and define their connectors by their operations with each other. These operations relate well to our requirements that involve the components interacting with each other such as administrative users adding and removing standard users and Classrooms.
