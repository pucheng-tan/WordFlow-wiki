# Authentication
Notes:
- user should have a unique code sent to them to activate their account with a school
- creating a school will create the super admin account at the same time
- the school should be entered when authenticating- and the most recent should be stored on the local device so that it doesn't need to be entered every time

# Welcome Screen
Notes:
- Admin menu differs from Super-Admin menu only in that it does not include School Management

# Typing Challenge
Notes:
- Programmer mode may require plenty of horizontal space
- Programmer mode will require that each language has rules for what separates "words" (before clearing them)
- home keys (f and j) need a visual marker
- virtual keyboard displays keys as user is typing them
- hovering on icon buttons shows more detailed information about the action

# Expanded Side Menu Items
Notes:
- Menu items will clearly indicate if they can be expanded with an arrow. Otherwise clicking them will show show content in the main window

# Classroom Management
Notes:
- it was cumbersome to change which tab was highlighted, and so only the text has been modified for the purposes of these sketches

# Reports
Notes:
- Reports settings is displayed in the side menu
- Report would be displayed in the main window after clicking "generate", to limit API calls
- The reports settings would be displayed in the user and classroom view with the user or classroom already selected and that option unavailable to change

# User Management
Notes:
- Admin view differs from Super-Admin in that Admins do not have the option to delete users or manage privilege, and user management will only show standard users in that Admin's Classrooms
