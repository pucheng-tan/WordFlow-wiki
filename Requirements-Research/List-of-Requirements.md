This is a page for brainstorming:

● List of Requirements

○ Using FURPS to identify both functional and non-functional requirements

○ Organized by scope - Must Have, Should Have, Could Have

from the Milestone 1 requirements document.


# Requirements
## Functional Requirements
//user tasks that the system needs to support
User shall be able to:
- choose between a "programmer" mode to type code, or "standard" to type words in English
- choose different programming languages in the programmer mode: Python, Java, PHP, HTML, C (TBD?)
- see how much of the given typing challenge they have typed highlighted
- see any errors in their typing highlighted on the typing challenge
- see how much time has elapsed since they have started the typing challenge ("stopwatch")
- see their a: total time, b: average wpm, c: place on the leaderboard (if applicable) upon completing the typing challenge
- copy an image with the above information for sharing purposes upon completing a challenge
- view a leaderboard of best (by wpm) typing challenges completed on their local device. The leaderboard will show a name, speed, time, and the type of challenge completed (max number of entries?)
- view an analysis of which 2-letter character combinations they are weakest at (??)
- complete basic typing challenges without an internet connection available

## Non-functional Requirements
//properties of the system or domain
### Python
- what version guys. Anything else? (I think Python 3, so maybe version 3? -Sarah)

### APIs
//TODO

### Performance

### Other stuff?
