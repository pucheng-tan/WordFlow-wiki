This is a page for brainstorming:

● List of Actors, Scenarios, and Use Cases

○ Including proper supporting descriptions for each

from the Milestone 1 requirements document.

## Actors
- user (different types of users exist, but I THINK they're the same actor? Find out for sure)
- APIs are actors (more specific! Nail down APIs!)

## Scenarios
//TODO: Flesh out with actual steps, add more scenarios
### 01. User selects a programming typing test
### 02. User selects a general typing test
### 03. User completes a typing test
### 04. User selects a typing test without an internet connection available
### 05. User selects a typing test requiring data from an unavailable API
### 06. User loses connection to API in the middle of a typing test
### 07. User views their typing test results
### 08. User views their typing analytics
### 09. User shares their typing test results
### 10. User takes longer than 10 minutes (Pick an arbitrary limit) to complete their typing test
### 11. API takes longer than 10 seconds (??) to respond to request for data
### 12. User selects character combinations to focus on (??)
### 13. User views the leaderboard
### 14. User decides to quit in the middle of the typing test

## Use Cases

(must have features all need use cases, should have features maybe a couple of use cases)
