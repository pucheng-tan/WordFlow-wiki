This page is for the APIs we've found as well as the APIs we're looking for.
## Looking for APIs that provide the following:
-Random Excerpts (e.g. books)

-Random Words

-Song Lyrics

-Code

## Potential APIs:
### Random Excerpts:

### Random Words:
https://developer.wordnik.com/ -also provides audio pronunciations (not yet tested)

### Song Lyrics:

### Code:

### Quotes:

-Quotes API (from Rapid API, tested using Python module requests)

URL: https://rapidapi.com/martin.svoboda/api/quotes15

It provides random quotes.

It also provides them in various languages such as German, Italian and French.
 

### Other:

-Numbers API (from Rapid API, tested using Python module requests)

URL: https://rapidapi.com/divad12/api/numbers-1

We could do a numbers mode maybe? Where the user just types numbers.

-Chuck Norris API (from Rapid API, tested using Python module requests)

URL: https://rapidapi.com/matchilling/api/chuck-norris

It's not specifically just letters, but it provides jokes that the user could potentially type.

-Jokes API (from Rapid API, testing using Python module requests)

URL: https://rapidapi.com/orthosie/api/jokes

Can give users the option of picking a category of joke to type or just randomly select the category for them.

(For the Chuck Norris API and the Jokes API, we could also remove punctuation before giving it to the user to just get the letters and words.)
